My Iterations for the Vending Machine Project

My micro project for a Vending Machine 

# How it works - by steps
- Shows the dictionary in which items are listed(item_dict)

- asks user for input for the items 

- asks for the quantity of the items

- moves the selected items and its corresponding quantity to a new dictionary(selected_items)

- if user types remove it asks for the item name and quantity then removes it 

- else if the user types done it calculates the price of the dictionary(selected_items) and prints it out

- def method are used for adding,removing,calculating items of the dictionary(selected_items)
